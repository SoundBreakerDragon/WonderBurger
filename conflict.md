Documnet the process showing your branch of another persons repo, your repo(main) and the conflict resolution process you undertook

When I created a branch from the main, I add inbetween the top bun and the bottum bun on the ingredients document some regular types of food that to would find on a burger lettace cheese, onions, patty, ect. While the other person I was paticipating took the same document from the main branch and copied it into there own branch. Inbetween their top and bottem bun they added some more questionable ingredients like tacos, corn and peanut butter. I don't know how someone would like peanut butter with mustard and ketchup on their burger but ok. I was the first one to pull into the main repo meaning I didn't suffer from any conflict issues however the other person did, so we had to move a few lines of ingredients around in order for the document to no longer suffer from any conflicts.
